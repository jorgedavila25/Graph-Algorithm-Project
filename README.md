Graph-Algorithm-Project
=======================

To Run the Program using the Makefile:
---------------------------------------
- To compile just type ```make all```
- To run the program, type ```./prog5 ../lib/Graph1.txt```
- To clean directory, ```make clean```

Information
-----------
* Look at the PDF file on the "Instruction" directory to look at the requirements for this program.

* If you want to use your own .txt file, make sure there's an extra space after the last number in each line except for the first row (the # that indicates how many Vertices are there), I suggest you use the one I provided since I've done numerous tests using it.

* This is the suggested input, to see that the Algorithms work properly:
  - Y,0,1,N,0,1
  - or
  - Y,1,3,N,1,3

* Part A, B, C is completed.
